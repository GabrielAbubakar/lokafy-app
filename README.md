# Lokafy Trial App (Instructions and Guide)
This is the base respository for the trial app for an application for frontend developer at Lokafy.


## Project Setup
This project is bootstrapped with the Vue Create App utility. This enabled the building of the user interface and fucitonality for the app with the Vue ecosystem. There is also the inclusion of the Vue router utility to enable the use of routes for the two different parts of the app.


## File Structure
Most of the app functionality is contained in the /src where it is divided into:
- src/components which contains reusable components and pieces of code.
- src/pages which contains the two pages contained in the app.
- src/router where the vue router functionality is initialized and set up.


## The Review Data
Because of the unavailablity of a database containing the data of the reviews of the clients, dummy data was hard coded into the Reviews Page through an array of objects containing dummy reviews. This can be found in the src/pages/ReviewsPage.vue directory.
